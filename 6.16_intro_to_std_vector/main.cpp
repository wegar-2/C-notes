// std::array <==== makes working with fixed arrays easier
// std::vector <==== makes working with dynamic arrays easier

/*
(The most) Important feature of C++'s vector: allows creating and operating on arrays
that have their size set at run-time. Length (size) of an std::vector does not have to be
specified at compile time. Memory allocation is carried out automatically!
